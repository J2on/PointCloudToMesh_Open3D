# PointCloudToMesh_Open3D
 This is a Python 3.9 code that uses Open3D to convert 3D point cloud data in the PCD (Point Cloud Data) format to OBJ (OBJect) mesh format. This code can convert example PCD data taken from [PointCloudLibrary/data](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/data/blob/master/tutorials/ism_test_cat.pcd).
